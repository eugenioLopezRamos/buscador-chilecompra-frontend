## TO DO ##


- Need to see  how to pass value of stateless functional components to container so it gets turned into state
- Need to set a debouncer for fetches!
- Clean up the actions/reducers/etc related to the test fetcher, and thank it for its service
- Add dates, currently <DateField /> does not alter state so you cant actually pick a date meaningfully

## DONE ##
- Need to separate the logic in some of the stateless functional components into actions
