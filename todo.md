## TO DO ##

- Will probably need logins. I think this is done with JWT?
- Have a list of queries that you can CRUD & store on the backend, and that are sent server side and then displayed in a search results table
- Search box for one time queries. This should have a button to save the query for the prev point.
- Set intervals for auto-queries with notifications if differences are found
- Saving N amount of query results data for archiving purposes/backups/whatever
- Export data to CSV/XLS
- The user has a  list of communication media where he/she'll get notifications. Can be email or SMS/something else
